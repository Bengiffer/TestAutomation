# TestAutomation

In this class I gained a bit more confidence with my skill in coding; learning how to better utilize QA skills both with using test automation and with my coding techinques. There are several ways I can ensure that my code and software are secure, byutlilzing test codes I am making sure that there are no escapes and integrates into the exsisting code properly, and by regularly debugging code while I am writing it while following best practices are all ways I can make sure my work is secure and free of errors. Which kind of goes in hand with figuring out user needs and incorporate them into programs. At some point, a little bit of experiance and knowledge are needed to know where some problem areas are to make sure you are adressing them properly. As user needs go, sometimes they will just tell you the requirments, but it also up to you to know the more technical needs to make them work. Thus I would approach designing software by really narrowing down the bare requirements and wats for it's purpose, then work on how to integrate them all together in a way that lets them work together in the most efeciant way.
